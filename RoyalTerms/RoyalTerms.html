        <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Last Revised: January 3, 2023 (the “Effective Date”)</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY AND COMPLY WITH THE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY VALID AT PARTICIPATING BURGER KING® RESTAURANTS IN THE 48 CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES (EXCL. ALASKA AND HAWAII) AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (THE “TERRITORY”) ONLY.
                The sponsor of the Royal Perks Program (the “Program”) is Burger King Corporation and its parent company (the “Sponsor”). By participating in the Program, you: (a) agree to be legally bound by (and to comply with): (i) these Terms and Conditions (the “Program Terms”); and (ii) the Sponsor’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and any other applicable terms that may be communicated to you in connection with the Program (including without limitation on the App (defined below), Website (defined below), in the Program Benefits (defined below) section of your Account (defined below) or other means as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion) (the “Additional Terms” and, together with the Program Terms and Specific Offer Terms (defined below), the “Terms”); (b) warrant and represent that you are a legal resident of one of the 48 continental United States or the District of Columbia; and (c) warrant and represent that you have reached the legal age of majority in your state of residence and that you will comply with all applicable laws in the course of accessing or participating in the Program.
                Please review the Terms frequently to understand the terms and conditions that apply to your access to and participation in the Program. By accessing and participating in the Program, you agree that the Sponsor reserves the right, and in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend and/or amend all or any portion of these Program Terms and any other information relating to the Program, and to terminate the Program in whole or in part, at any time and without notice (unless required by applicable law). In the event the Program is terminated, the Program Terms will also be terminated and your Crowns (defined below) shall expire concurrently with the termination of the Program – provided that the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion and without any obligation to do so, extend the Crowns (defined below) expiry date beyond the termination of the Program. Any amendment will be effective immediately upon posting the amended Program Terms to https://www.bk.com/terms-conditions-rewards and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such amendment. Only where required by applicable law or at the Sponsor’s sole discretion, the Sponsor will provide notice of amendment to these Program Terms, as set out below.
                Where required by applicable law or at the Sponsor’s sole discretion: The Sponsor will provide written notice of a proposed amendment to these Program Terms at least 30 days (or such longer period as may be required by applicable law) before the amendment comes into effect, using messages delivered within your Account, the App and/or the Website (as defined below), email and/or your mailing address, or any other contact information the Sponsor has for you in the Sponsor’s discretion. If you do not agree with a proposed amendment, you may terminate your participation in the Program at any time in the 30 day period prior to the amendment coming into effect, or, if the amendment increases your obligations or decreases the Sponsor’s obligations under these Program Terms, you may terminate your participation in the Program no later than 30 days after the amendment comes into effect. These Program Terms may be terminated in accordance with this section, at no cost or penalty, by sending the Sponsor a notice to that effect.
                To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, your continued access and participation in the Program following an amendment, suspension or notice period, as applicable, constitutes your full acceptance of, and agreement to be legally bound by, these Program Terms as revised. If you do not agree to these Program Terms, you must stop accessing and participating in the Program.
                By accessing and otherwise participating in the Program, you agree that the Sponsor may collect, use and disclose your personal information to administer and fulfill the Program, including without limitation provide and manage products and services you request under the Program, communicate with you about the Program (including without limitation via electronic communications) and otherwise use your personal information with your consent or at your direction, and as set out in our Privacy Policy. These Program Terms do not limit any other consent(s) that you may provide the Sponsor or others in relation to the collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information, or alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with the Sponsor for other products or services.
                Under California law, the Program may be considered a financial incentive. To view our Notice of Financial Incentive please visit: Notice of Financial Incentive.
                About the Program
                By participating in the Program, you can earn points (“Crowns”) every time you visit a participating Burger King® restaurant in the Territory and complete an Eligible Transaction (defined below). Crowns may be redeemed at participating Burger King® restaurants in the Territory for select eligible items (the “Eligible Menu Items”), subject to compliance with these Program Terms (“Rewards”). From time to time, other bonus features and offers may also be made available to you, allowing you to receive other Burger King® or third-party benefits (the “Bonus Feature(s)”), earn and redeem Crowns in additional ways, or otherwise participate in the Program, all as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion (the “Program Benefits”).
                Participating in the Program
                To participate in the Program, you must have a valid Burger King® digital account (the “Account”). To create an Account:
                • Download and register on the BK® App (the “App”) using your smart phone, or• Go to bk.com (the “Website”) and click “Sign Up.”
                By registering on the App or Website, you will automatically be enrolled as a member of the Program (individually referred to as “Member” and collectively “Members”). There is a limit of one (1) Account per person. Each Account is specific to an individual and may not be shared, transferred or sold. Crowns and Rewards earned under the Program have no cash value. Signing up for an Account is free of charge. If you do not wish to participate in the Program, click HERE to request deletion of your account and data.
                (i) Earning Crowns
                As a Member, you will earn ten (10) Crowns for every $1.00 USD spent (after discounts, excluding applicable taxes and fees) at a participating Burger King® restaurant in the Territory using one of the following methods: (1) on the App or Website for dine-in, pick up or delivery, excluding third-party food delivery aggregator orders; or (2) on in-restaurant orders by using one of the following (i) the 6-digit “My Code” (where available) located in your Account, or (ii) effective January 23, 2023, at participating Burger King® restaurants in the Territory, using a credit card linked to your Account (“Linked Card”) (each an “Eligible Transaction”).
                You can earn Crowns on up to three (3) Eligible Transactions per Account per day. Your first three (3) Eligible Transactions, regardless of method, will accrue Crowns to your Account.
                If your Eligible Transaction involves the use of a digital coupon, you will earn Crowns based on actual amount paid. For the avoidance of doubt, you will not get Crowns for the discounted amount of your transaction. Print coupons cannot be used in connection with the Program. If your amount paid includes a decimal, the Crowns earned will be rounded down to the nearest tenth. You will not earn additional Crowns when using Crowns to redeem any reward(s) you earn. If you make a purchase in addition to the use of Crowns during one single transaction, you will earn Crowns on the actual amount paid. An Eligible Transaction paid with your BK Crown gift card will result in Crowns. A transaction made to purchase or reload a BK Crown gift card is not an Eligible Transaction.
                Crowns earned in connection with an Eligible Transaction will be automatically applied to your Account within 48 hours of completing the Eligible Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, a transaction completed via a third-party ordering website, a delivery aggregator or other unauthorized means is not an Eligible Transaction. A transaction that does not result in a completed transaction equal or greater than $1.00 USD (after discounts, excluding applicable taxes and fees) is not an Eligible Transaction.
                If you forget to use either the 6-digit “My Code” located in your Account or your Linked Card during your in-restaurant purchase, please visit bk.com/claim-points to claim your Crowns within 48 hours of purchase. Account registration required. Claiming Crowns via in-restaurant receipt is only available at participating U.S. Burger King® restaurants. Limit one (1) receipt per day is eligible for Crowns. A valid receipt is required to claim your Crowns. Lost, stolen, or misplaced receipts cannot be replaced.
                (ii) Rewards
                Members that comply with the Terms may redeem Crowns for Eligible Menu Items (as listed below) in accordance with the redemption requirements set out below.
                Rewards can be redeemed at a participating Burger King® restaurant in the Territory on Mobile Orders or In-Restaurant Orders. To redeem a reward, visit “My Code” on the App or Website and click “Add Reward and Offer.” To redeem a reward on an In-Restaurant Order, please click “Redeem in Restaurant” and show the 6-digit "My Code" on your Account at time of purchase. For In-Restaurant Orders, the 6-digit "My Code" has a limit of one (1) digital coupon/offer per transaction. Limit one (1) 6-digit "My Code" per order. Digital coupons/offers are limited to one every 60 minutes.
                Each Eligible Menu Item excludes the cost of modifications, for example extra bacon or add cheese. If Crowns are redeemed for an Eligible Menu Item that includes a modifier, the price of the modifier will be charged separately. Rewards can be combined with one (1) digital offer/coupon. Print coupons cannot be used in connection with the Program. Eligible Menu Items are subject to availability at participating Burger King® restaurants in the Territory. Kitchen hours may vary by participating restaurant.

Personalized Offers may also be made available to you, allowing you to earn or redeem Crowns in additional ways or receive certain Rewards. If a Personalized Offer is made available to you, you will be notified in your Account, via email, push notification, or SMS, depending on your communication preferences, or other means as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion.

Bonus Features are subject to change at any time without notice, all as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion. Certain Bonus Features made available to you may require you to first activate them via your Account in accordance with their respective Specific Offer Terms (and, as applicable in respect of any such Bonus Feature, any transaction completed prior to activation will not count as an Eligible Transaction in connection with such Bonus Feature). Certain Bonus Features may require you to visit a participating Burger King® restaurant in the Territory.
                    Blackout Periods
                    From time to time Sponsor may restrict redemption of Crowns (“Blackout Period(s)”). These Blackout Periods will be communicated to you, as applicable.
                    Expiration of Crowns
                    To the fullest extent permitted by law, all Crowns earned in your Account will expire 180 days after the last Eligible Transaction has been made by Member. For example, Crowns earned on February 26, 2021 will expire on August 26, 2021 to the extent no Eligible Transaction has been made during such period. You must have at least one Eligible Transaction every 180 days or all Crowns in your Account will expire and no longer be available for redemption.

                    General Conditions
                    Your Account, Crowns, Rewards, Program Benefits, and Account are personal to you and may not be sold, transferred or assigned to, or shared with, family, friends or others (except as specifically permitted by the Sponsor, in its sole and absolute discretion), or used by you for any commercial purpose. If it is discovered by the Sponsor (using any evidence or other information made available to or otherwise discovered by the Sponsor) that you have attempted to: (i) exceed any of the limits stated in the Terms; (ii) use someone else’s transactions to earn Crowns on your Account; and/or (ii) use multiple names, identities, email addresses and/or any automated, macro, script, robotic or other system(s) or program(s) to register for or otherwise participate in, or to disrupt, this Program, then you may be disqualified from the Program and/or your Account, Crowns, Rewards, Program Benefits, and any other aspect of the Program made available to you may be suspended, revoked, nullified and/or voided, all in the sole and absolute discretion of the Sponsor. You and your Account, Crowns, Rewards, Program Benefits, and any other information or activities associated with this Program (collectively, “Program-related Information”) are subject to verification at any time and for any reason. The Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to require any type of proof (including without limitation proof of identity, eligibility and/or compliance with these Terms in a form acceptable to the Sponsor – including, without limitation, government issued photo identification): (i) for the purposes of verifying your eligibility to participate in this Program; (ii) for the purposes of verifying the eligibility and/or legitimacy of any Program-related Information that has been used or submitted in connection with this Program; and/or (iii) for any other reason the Sponsor deems necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion, for the purposes of administering this Program in accordance with the letter and spirit of these Terms. If the Sponsor deems you are not complying with the letter and spirit of these Terms, or you fail to provide such proof to the complete satisfaction of the Sponsor within the timeline specified by the Sponsor, then you may be disqualified from the Program (and your Account, Crowns, Rewards, Program Benefits, and any other aspect of the Program made available to you may be suspended, revoked, nullified and voided) in the sole and absolute discretion of the Sponsor. The sole determinant of the time for the purposes of this Program will be the Sponsor’s server machine(s). Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, suspend, cancel or combine Accounts that appear to be duplicative.
                    All Program-related Information is and remains the sole and exclusive property of the Sponsor. The decisions of the Sponsor with respect to all aspects of this Program are final and binding on all participants without right of appeal, including, without limitation, any decisions regarding the eligibility or disqualification of Eligible Transactions, Rewards, Program Offers, Crowns, or members. ANYONE DEEMED BY THE SPONSOR TO BE IN VIOLATION OF THESE TERMS FOR ANY REASON IS SUBJECT TO DISQUALIFICATION IN THE SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION OF THE SPONSOR AT ANY TIME. Sponsor also reserves the right to "unregister" and make ineligible for use in connection with the Program any Account that has been inactive for two (2) consecutive years without notice to you, unless otherwise required by law. An Account is considered inactive if no Eligible Transactions or no Crowns have been earned in connection with such Account (as determined by the Sponsor in its sole and absolute discretion on the basis of its records). In the event that your Account is rendered ineligible, then all Crowns and any Rewards and/or Program Benefits associated with such Account are revoked, nullified and voided.
                    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, by participating in the Program, you hereby: (i) release the Sponsor, its parent company, affiliates, any other entity or person involved in the organization, administration or fulfillment of the Program and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, franchisees, employees, representatives, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the “Program Parties”) from any loss, liability, claim, demand, damage or expense that arises in connection with your participation in the Program (including without limitation with any use or misuse of Program-related Information); and (ii) agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Program Parties from any loss, liability, claim, demand, damage or expense asserted by any entity or person relating in any way to your breach of any of the Terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Program Parties are not responsible for: (a) late, lost, misdirected, delayed, incomplete or incompatible Program-related Information (all of which are void); (b) any failure of an Account, the Website, the App or any other Program-related software, hardware or other type of system; (c) any technical malfunction or other problems of any nature whatsoever, including, without limitation, those relating to the telephone network or lines, computer on-line systems, servers, access providers, computer equipment or software; (c) any injury or damage to participant’s or any other person’s computer, mobile device, tablet or other device related to or resulting from participating in the Program; and/or (d) any combination of the above.
                    SPONSOR PROVIDES THE PROGRAM “AS IS” AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DESIGN, ACCURACY, CAPABILITY, SUFFICIENCY, SUITABILITY, CAPACITY, COMPLETENESS OR AVAILABILITY.
                    The Terms, and all related matters shall be governed solely by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction. You hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Southern District of Florida in relation to all disputes arising from or related to the Terms, and any related matters.
                    The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Program Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision is determined to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable or illegal, these Program Terms shall otherwise remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with the terms as if the invalid or illegal provision were not contained herein.</p>
